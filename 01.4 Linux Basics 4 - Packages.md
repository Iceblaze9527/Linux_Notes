# 01.4 Linux Basics 4 - Packages
## 7. Packages
### 7.1 Software Distribution
-  **upstream providers**: the people (or sometimes a single person) that write the software. 
	- Compile their code and write up how to get it installed.
	- Work on getting out new software and update existing software. 
- **package maintainers**: who handle getting this piece of software in the hands of the users. 
	- Review, manage and distribute this software in the form of packages.

### 7.2 Package Repositories
Your distribution already comes with pre-approved sources to get packages from and this is how it installs all the base packages you see on your system.

- Debian sources file: `/etc/apt/sources.list`

### 7.3 `tar` and `gzip`
#### 7.3.1 Compressing files with `gzip`
`gzip` is program used to compress files in Linux, they end in a `.gz` extension.

- To compress a file down:  `gzip FILENAME1, FILENAME2, ...`
	- `-l , --list`: list compressed file contents
	- `-r , --recursive`: recursive operate recursively on directories
- To decompress the file: `gunzip FILENAME1, FILENAME2, ...`
	- `-l , --list`: list compressed file contents
	- `-r , --recursive`: recursive operate recursively on directories

#### 7.3.2 Creating archives with tar
Unfortunately, `gzip` can't add multiple files into one archive for us. Luckily we have the `tar` program which does. When you create an archive using `tar`, it will have a `.tar` extension.

```bash
$ tar cvf mytarfile.tar mycoolfile1 mycoolfile2
```

- `c`: create
- `v`: tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it's doing
- `f`: the filename of the tar file has to come after this option, 
  if you are creating a tar file you'll have to come up with a name

#### 7.3.3 Unpacking archives with tar
```bash
$ tar xvf mytarfile.tar
```
- `x`: extract
- `v`: tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it's doing
- `f`: the file you want to extract

#### 7.3.4 Compressing/uncompressing archives with tar and gzip
Many times you'll see a tar file that has been compressed such as: `mycompressedarchive.tar.gz`, all you need to do is work outside in, so first remove the compression with gunzip and then you can unpack the tar file. Or you can alternatively use the `z` option with `tar`, which just tells it to use the `gzip` or `gunzip` utility.

- Create a compressed tar file:  `tar czf myfile.tar.gz`
- Uncompress and unpack:  `tar xzf file.tar`

### 7.4 `rpm` and `dpkg`
Just like `.exe` is a single executable file, so is `.deb` and `.rpm`. You normally wouldn't see these if you use package repositories, but if you directly download packages, you will most likely get them in these popular format. Obviously, they are exclusive to their distributions, `.deb` for Debian based and `.rpm` for Red Hat based.

To install these direct packages, you can use the package management commands: `rpm` and `dpkg`. These tools are used to install package files, however they will not install the package dependencies, so if your package had 10 dependencies, you would have to install those packages separately and then their dependencies and so on and so forth. 

#### 7.4.1 Install a package
```bash
Debian: $ dpkg -i some_deb_package.deb
RPM: $ rpm -i some_rpm_package.rpm
```  

- `i` stands for install. You can also use the longer format of `--install`.

#### 7.4.2 Remove a package
```bash
Debian: $ dpkg -r some_deb_package.deb
RPM: $ rpm -e some_rpm_package.rpm
```

- Debian: `r` for remove
- RPM: `e` for erase

#### 7.4.3 List installed packages
```bash
Debian: $ dpkg -l 
RPM: $ rpm -qa
```

- Debian: `l` for list  
- RPM: `q` for query and `a` for all

### 7.5 `yum` and `apt`
These systems come with all the fixins to make package installation, removal and changes easier, including installing package dependencies. Two of the most popular management systems is `yum` and `apt`. Yum is exclusive to the Red Hat family and apt is exclusively to the Debian family.

#### 7.5.1 Install a package from a repository
```bash  
Debian: $ apt install package_name  
RPM: $ yum install package_name
``` 

#### 7.5.2 Remove a package
```bash
Debian: $ apt remove package_name
RPM: $ yum erase package_name
```  

#### 7.5.3 Updating packages for a repository
It's always best practice to update your package repositories so they are up to date before you install and update a package.
```bash
Debian: $ apt update; apt upgrade
RPM: $ yum update
```

#### 7.5.4 Get information about an installed package
```bash 
Debian: $ apt show package_name
RPM: $ yum info package_name
```

### 7.6 Compile Source Code
Often times you will encounter an obscure package that only comes in the form of pure source code. You'll need to use a few commands to get that source code package compiled and installed on your system.

#### 7.6.1 install build-essential
First thing is first, you'll need to have software to install the tools that will allow you to compile source code.

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

Once you do that, extract the contents of the package file, most likely a .tar.gz file.

```bash
$ tar -xzvf package.tar.gz
```

Before you do anything, take a look at the README or INSTALL file inside the package. Sometimes there will be specific installation instructions.

#### 7.6.2 Makefile
Depending on what compile method that the developer used, you'll have to use different commands, such as `cmake` or something else. However, most commonly you'll see basic `make` compilation, so we'll discuss that:

Inside the package contents will be a configure script, this script checks for dependencies on your system and if you are missing anything, you'll see an error and you'll need to fix those dependencies.

```bash
$ ./configure
```

The `./` allows you to execute a script in the current directory.

```bash
$ make
```

Inside of the package contents, there is a file called Makefile that contains rules to building the software. When you run the make command, it looks at this file to build the software.

Use `checkinstall` command instead of `make install`. This command will make a `.deb` file for you that you can easily install and uninstall.

```bash
$ sudo checkinstall
```

This command will essentially `make install` and build a `.deb` package and install it. This makes it easier to remove the package later on.
