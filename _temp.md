A Linux system is divided into three main parts:
-   Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
-   Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
-   User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.

## TODO
- `echo`
- `env` : show environment variable
- `alias new_command='old_command'` 
- `nohup <command> &`
- `sudo timeshift --restore --snapshot '2021-07-30_16-55-23' --skip-grub`
