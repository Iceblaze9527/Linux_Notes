# 01.3 Linux Basics 3 - Processes
## 6. Processes
Process information is stored in a special filesystem known as the `/proc` filesystem.

### 6.1 Programs and Processes
#### 6.1.1 Relationship: A process is an instance of a running program
- Program: a specific kind of procedure to complete a certain task
- Processes: truly take advantage of computer's memory, CPU, I/O and other physical resources (allocated by system). 
- A program may have many instances (of course processes).

#### 6.1.2 Kernels
The kernel is in charge of processes, when we run a program the kernel loads up the code of the program in memory, determines and allocates resources and then keeps tabs on each process, it knows:
-   The status of the process
-   The resources the process is using and receives
-   The process owner
-   Signal handling (more on that later)
-   And basically everything else

All processes are trying to get a taste of that sweet resource pie, it's the kernel's job to make sure that processes get the right amount of resources depending on process demands. When a process ends, the resources it used are now freed up for other processes.

### 6.2 TTY - Terminal and Console
There are two types of terminals, regular **terminal devices** and **pseudoterminal devices**. 

A **regular terminal** device is a native terminal device (namely a hardwire like keyboard or typewritter) that you can type into and send output to your system.

A **pseudoterminal** is virtual terminal software, they emulate real terminals with the shell terminal window and are denoted by `PTS` , like, if you look at ps again, you'll see your shell process under `pts/*`.

Processes are usually bound to a controlling terminal. There are processes such as daemon processes, which are special processes that are essentially keeping the system running. They often start at system boot and usually get terminated when the system is shutdown. They run in the background and since we don't want these special processes to get terminated they are not bound to a controlling terminal. In the ps output, the TTY is listed as a  `?` meaning it does not have a controlling terminal.

As for **console**, it's just a kind of special terminal attached to a mainframe in the past for the operators to check the machine's working state, and here's the only reason that console is special since no other terminal is virtually usable before the mainframe system launches properly.

For more about the relationship between terminal and console, check [this](https://www.linuxdashen.com/%E4%BD%A0%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%98%AF%E7%BB%88%E7%AB%AF%E5%90%97%EF%BC%9F) out.

### 6.3 `ps` and `top`
#### 6.3.1 `ps`
display running processes on screen

- Basic options: 
	- `-A. -e` : all processes
	- `-r` : only running processes
	- `T` : all processes on this terminal
- Selection by list:
	- `-C` : command name
	- `-G` : real group id or name
	- `-g` : session of effective group name
	- `-l` : long format (`PPID` field included)
	- `-P , --pid` : process id
	- `--ppid` : parent process id
	- `-s , --sid` : session id
	- `-t , --tty` : terminal
	- `-u , --user` : effective user id or name
	- `-x` : processes without controlling ttys

#### 6.3.2 `top` and `htop`
- `top`: real time information about the processes running on your system instead of a snapshot. default refresh every 10 seconds.
- `htop`: an interactive process viewer for Unix systems. It is a text-mode application (for console or X terminals) and requires ncurses.

#### 6.3.4  `NI` 
Processes use the CPU for a small amount of time called a time slice. Then they pause for milliseconds and another process gets a little time slice. By default, process scheduling happens in this round-robin fashion. Every process gets enough time slices until it's finished processing. The kernel handles all of these switching of processes and it does a pretty good job at it most of the time.

Processes aren't able to decide when and how long they get CPU time, if all processes behaved normally they would each (roughly) get an equal amount of CPU time. However, there is a way to influence the kernel's process scheduling algorithm with a nice value.

A high number means the process is nice and has a lower priority for the CPU and a low or negative number means the process is not very nice and it wants to get as much of the CPU as possible.

- `nice process` : adjust niceness of a new process (ranging from -20 to 19)
	- `no command` : show current niceness 
	- `-n` : add integer N to the niceness (default 10)
- `renice process` : alter the priority of existing processes
	- `-n` : specify the nice increment value
	- `-p` : interpret argument as process ID
	- `-g`: interpret argument as process group ID
	- `-u`: interpret argument as username or user ID

#### 6.3.5 [STAT - Process Status](http://thelinuxstuff.blogspot.com/2012/08/process-state-codes-in-ps-output.html)
A linux process can be in a number of different states.

The codes used are:

| Code | Meaning                                                                |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| D    | Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO) : processes that cannot be killed or interrupted with a signal, usually to make them go away you have to reboot or fix the issue|
| R    | Running or runnable (on run queue) : it is just waiting for the CPU to process it |
| S    | Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete) : waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal |
| T    | Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced. |
| X    | dead (should never be seen)                                            |
| Z    | Defunct (“zombie”) process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.   |

| <    | high-priority (not nice to other users)                       |
| N    | low-priority (nice to other users)                            |
| L    | has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)    |
| s    | is a session leader                                           |
| l    | is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do) |
| +    | is in the foreground process group                            |

### 6.4 Process Lifecycle
#### 6.4.1 Process Creation
When a new process is created, an existing process basically clones itself using something called the `fork system call`. The `fork system call` creates a mostly identical child process, this child process takes on a new process ID (`PID`) and the original process becomes its parent process and has something called a parent process ID (`PPID`). Afterwards, the child process can either continue to use the same program its parent was using before or more often use the `execve system call` to launch up a new program. This system call destroys the memory management that the kernel put into place for that process and sets up new ones for the new program.

So if every process has to have a parent and they are just forks of each other, there must be a mother of all processes. When the system boots up, the kernels creates a process called `init`, it has a `PID` of 1. The `init` process can't be terminated unless the system shuts down. It runs with `root` privileges and runs many processes that keep the system running. 

#### 6.4.2 Signals
A signal is a notification to a process that something has happened.They are software interrupts and they have lots of uses:

-   A user can type one of the special terminal characters (`Ctrl-C`) or (`Ctrl-Z`) to kill, interrupt or suspend processes
-   Hardware issues can occur and the kernel wants to notify the process
-   Software issues can occur and the kernel wants to notify the process
-   They are basically ways processes can communicate

When a signal is generated by some event, it's then delivered to a process, it's considered in a pending state until it's delivered. When the process is ran, the signal will be delivered. However, processes have signal masks and they can set signal delivery to be blocked if specified. When a signal is delivered, a process can do a multitude of things:

-   Ignore the signal
-   "Catch" the signal and perform a specific handler routine
-   Process can be terminated, as opposed to the normal exit system call
-   Block the signal, depending on the signal mask

Each signal is defined by integers with symbolic names that are in the form of SIGxxx. Some of the most common signals are:

-   `SIGHUP` or `HUP` or `1` : Hangup, sent to a process when the controlling terminal is closed. For example, if you closed a terminal window that had a process running in it, you would get a `SIGHUP` signal. So basically you've been hung up on
-   `SIGINT` or `INT` or `2` : Is an interrupt signal, so you can use `Ctrl-C` and the system will try to gracefully kill the process
-   `SIGKILL` or `KILL` or `9` : Kill the process, kill it with fire, doesn't do any cleanup
-   `SIGSEGV` or `SEGV` or `11`: Segmentation fault
-   `SIGTERM` or `TERM` or `15` : Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup first
-   `SIGSTOP` or `STOP` : Stop/suspend a process

Numbers can vary with signals so they are usually referred by their names.

Some signals are unblockable, one example is the `SIGKILL` signal. The `KILL` signal destroys the process.

#### 6.4.3 Process Termination
A process can exit using the `_exit` system call, this will free up the resources that process was using for reallocation. So when a process is ready to terminate, it lets the kernel know why it's terminating with something called a termination status. Most commonly a status of `0` means that the process succeeded. However, that's not enough to completely terminate a process. The parent process has to acknowledge the termination of the child process by using the `wait` system call and what this does is that it checks the termination status of the child process. 

You can also send signals that terminate processes:

- `kill` : send a signal to a job, by default it sends a `TERM` signal
	- `-s SIGNAME` : followed by signal name
	- `-n SIGNUM` : followed by signal number

#### 6.4.4 Orphan Processes & Zombie Processses
When a parent process dies before a child process, the kernel knows that it's not going to get a `wait` call, so instead it makes these processes "orphans" and puts them under the care of `init` (remember mother of all processes). `Init` will eventually perform the `wait` system call for these orphans so they can die.

What happens when a child terminates and the parent process hasn't called `wait` yet? We still want to be able to see how a child process terminated, so even though the child process finished, the kernel turns the child process into a zombie process. The resources the child process used are still freed up for other processes, however there is still an entry in the process table for this zombie. Zombie processes also cannot be killed, since they are technically "dead", so you can't use signals to kill them. Eventually if the parent process calls the `wait` system call, the zombie will disappear, this is known as "reaping". If the parent doesn't perform a `wait` call, `init` will adopt the zombie and automatically perform `wait` and remove the zombie. It can be a bad thing to have too many zombie processes, since they take up space on the process table, if it fills up it will prevent other processes from running.

### 6.5 `/proc` file system
Remember everything in Linux is a file, even processes. Process information is stored in a special filesystem known as the `/proc` filesystem.

``$ ls /proc``

You should see multiple values in here, there are sub-directories for every `PID`. If you looked at a `PID` in the `ps` output, you would be able to find it in the `/proc` directory.

Go ahead and enter one of the processes and look at that file:

``$ cat /proc/12345/status``

You should see process state information and well as more detailed information. The `/proc` directory is how the kernel is views the system, so there is a lot more information here than what you would see in `ps`.

### 6.6 job control
#### 6.6.1 `&`
Sending a job to the background

#### 6.6.2 `jobs`
display status of jobs
- `-l` : list process ID

job ID | status | command
--|--|--
[1] | Running | sleep 1000 &
[2]- | Running | sleep 1001 &
[3]+ | Running | sleep 1002 &

- **+**  :  the job is the most recent background job that started
- **-**  :  is the second most recent command

#### 6.6.3 `bg` and `fg`
- `bg job_id` : move jobs to the background
	- If you already ran a job and want to send it to the background, you don't have to terminate it and start over again. First suspend the job with `Ctrl-Z`, then run the `bg` command to send it to the background.
- `fg %job_id`: move jobs to the foreground
- `kill %job_id`: kill jobs in the background
- `kill $(jobs -p)`: kill all jobs in the background
